Syngenta App
============

An Android application that displays information about Syngenta products and bulk loading sites.

The interface is a tabbed view that you can swipe to the left or right for different portions of the app. 

The far left screen is a list of all products, and when clicked, it will display certain information about that product:
The Full Name, the weight in pounds per gallon, and the maximum capacity that will fit in a trailer.

The middle screen has a drop down list on the left and right sides of the screen and a button in the middle. You can
select the product that is currently on the trailer from the list on the left, and the next one to be loaded from the 
list on the right. When you click submit it will tell you if the products are compatible or if you will need to wash the 
trailer before loading the next product.

The far right screen is a list of all of the bulk loading sites we load out of, and when you click on one of them from 
the list, it will pull up another list of all of the products they can load there.
